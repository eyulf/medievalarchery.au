    The Medieval Archery Society (MAS) is a group of like minded people who primarily portray an English mercenary company (Free Company) in France, circa 1365, based in Sydney, Australia.

    The main focus of the group is archery, but we have members who have skills in medieval cooking, leatherwork, spinning, black smithing, fletching and foot combat. The group is also interested in archery from other periods of history, and other cultures. The group attends medieval festivals, often running archery for the public.
