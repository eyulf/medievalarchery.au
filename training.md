MAS shoots at the [Campbelltown Steam and Machinery Museum][museum] on the 2nd and 4th Sunday of the month. Public are welcome by invitation only.

If you are interested in coming along and seeing if re-enactment with our group is for you, please [contact][contact] us via email to receive an invitation. We charge $10 for the public to attend, and $10 if you need to hire equipment (Bow and/or Arrows).

Please note we only have a finite amount of bows and arrows so bookings are essential.
