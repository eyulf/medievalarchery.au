                        </header>
                        <p>MAS members are charged a flat $5 a month to shoot at the <a href="{{ museum.url }}" title="{{ museum.name }}">Campbelltown Steam and Machinery Museum</a>. Your first day in the month is $5, any other shooting on site is free. Members are expected to buy there own bow and arrows as soon as they are able, the MAS board are often able to give help and guidance with this. (You may find the buying of bows becomes addictive, many of our members own more than one bow).</p>

                                    <p>MAS attends medieval festivals and some charity events. Half the fun of this hobby is sharing it with the general public. We expect our members to try to attend these festivals, as the club gets paid for our participation, this allows our club to replenish arrows, and buy things to increase your enjoyment of our hobby.</p>

                                    <p>We do not enforce any gender roles. If you are a woman and wish to dress as a man, that is fine, and visa versa. Most people who join our club are rather new to re-enactment, and the club works hard to help them attain a look as close to the 14th Century as possible. We are able to provide help and contacts to help you become as authentic as possible.</p>
