                    </header>
                    <p> The Medieval Archery Society (MAS) is a group of like minded people who primarily portray an English mercenary company (Free Company) in France, circa 1365, based in Sydney, Australia.</p>
                    <p>The main focus of the group is archery, but we have members who have skills in medieval cooking, leatherwork, spinning, black smithing, fletching and foot combat. The group is also interested in archery from other periods of history, and other cultures. The group attends medieval festivals, often running archery for the public. </p>

                        </header>
                        <p>MAS members are charged a flat $5 a month to shoot at the <a href="{{ museum['url'] }}" title="{{ museum['name'] }}">Campbelltown Steam and Machinery Museum</a>. Your first day in the month is $5, any other shooting on site is free.

                                    </header>
                                    <p>MAS attends medieval festivals and some charity events. Half the fun of this hobby is sharing it with the general public. We expect our members to try to attend these festivals, as the club gets paid for our participation, this allows our club to replenish arrows, and buy things to increase your enjoyment of our hobby.</p>
                                    <p>For a beginners guide of what you need and what to expect at festivals click link below to get the basic info you need in the Festival Guide for Beginners.</p>

                                    <p>We do not enforce any gender roles. If you are a woman and wish to dress as a man, that is fine, and visa versa. Most people who join our club are rather new to re-enactment, and the club works hard to help them attain a look as close to the 14th Century as possible. We are able to provide help and contacts to help you become as authentic as possible.</p>
                                    <p>Any member dressing as a male is expected to attain garb and kit to approximate a 14th century English archer during the 100 years war.</p>
